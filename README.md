# The Annoying Traps

The Annoying Traps is a simple yet engaging vertical game where players must navigate a chain past a series of sneaky ropes without getting caught. The objective is to reach the endpoint, avoiding all obstacles that try to thwart your progress. The game showcases basic mechanics like collision detection, dynamic environment interactions, and a restart feature.

## Gameplay

- **Obstacles**: Multiple ropes are placed strategically with varying lengths and speeds, which activate when the chain comes within range and attempt to catch it.
- **Winning**: Reach the blue endpoint to win the game. A message will confirm your success.
- **Game Over**: If a rope catches the chain, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
